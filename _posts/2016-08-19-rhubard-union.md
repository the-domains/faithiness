  I would prefer to be in someone’s home, with beer and wine, but this is a
  place to start. Jesus said “the Kingdom of God is upon you”. It’s not
  something you wait for like a revolution or apocalypse. It’s something you
  do–right now. So let’s do it right now. We’ll get together and just do the
  things we’ve been waiting for: share our thoughts, food, wine, and lives.

## **Hey internet, thanks for being here. I wanted to get everyone together for a few reasons. First, this is just something I want to do much more often than I have been able to do for the past few years----be with friends, talk about stuff. **

**I would prefer to be in someone's home, with beer and wine, but this is a place to start. Jesus said "the Kingdom of God is upon you".

**The second reason is related. A series of questions that have been provoking me for years----ideas I'm fighting with and fighting for. Namely, what is the nature of Christian faith today? I take very seriously the modern and postmodern critiques of religion. To me, they have been the voices of the prophets, spotlighting a very long history of Christian abuse and neglect. They've shown how god-talk and truth-talk are political grabs at power, how theology cloaks our quest for privilege, and how the discourse **_**about**_**Jesus has inverted the life **_**of**_**Jesus. For several years now, I have held my faith over that flame and a lot has been burned up. I just call that "metanoia", a key word in the mouth of Jesus which means to change your mind, or better yet heart. But after this deconstruction, I don't believe that I'm in a position of unbelief. I have repented of the way I held my Christian faith, but not of Christ or of faith. In fact, I do believe that I am more Christian now than I ever was in my most reformed days.**

> **So this conversation is for anyone who approaches their life and faith with fear and trembling. It's not necessary that you share my embrace of the critics, or my skepticism of Christian leaders (anyone who stands to profit from the docile obedience Church). You will certainly be more comfortable if you do. I'll be very cozy with **
