  Let’s kick this whole thing off, and what better place to begin than “in the
  beginning”. In Genesis, the foundations are laid and something elemental and
  irreducible is embedded the world––the forms and colors, the very spirit of
  what is given to us in life. I like to start here not just because it makes
  sense, but because it harbors so many of difficulties and beauties that run
  throughout the entire discussion of faith. What do we do with the sacred
  texts, especially when the seem to overlap with other texts, such as history
  or science? Even mentioning that century-old scuffle is nauseating. Should we
  embrace these stories––why––how? It kicks off the topics I want to cover in
  this project: life, faith, biblical hermeneutics, theology, Jesus, the gospel.

**So the first "song" in this "album" will be about creation, and may include seven small pieces (one for each day). What do I want to say, explore, chase down? For the sake a clarity, I'll break my thoughts into positive and negative----deconstructive and constructive. Here we explore the negative.**

**Firstly, Genesis is not a scientific discourse. It has nothing to say about the history of the cosmos, or the origins of biological life. It is an artistic, poetic, emotive, meaning-making, value-charged story about life and the world, taking a special look at the foundations, the genesis of our experience in the world. You can tell the story of the world from the perspective of physics or biology----that's what science does. But it is not nearly as interesting as the sacred, poetic myths which have been passed down around campfires, under the stars, from one generation to another. The meaning I find in the world is not described fully in science, and Genesis is meant to get closer to that meaning by its poetic form. This point is not something to argue about, or to take overly seriously. It's so tiresome. I think it's best to be light, humorous, and sarcastic about it. It's just not an interesting conversation, at least in the conventional framing, so I would like to poke a little fun (at myself) and move on.**
