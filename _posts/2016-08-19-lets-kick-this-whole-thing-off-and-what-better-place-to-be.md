  Let’s kick this whole thing off, and what better place to begin than “in the
  beginning”. In Genesis, the foundations are laid and something elemental and
  irreducible is embedded the world––the forms and colors, the very spirit of
  what is given to us in life. I like to start here not just because it makes
  sense, but because it harbors so many of difficulties and beauties that run
  throughout the entire discussion of faith. What do we do with the sacred
  texts, especially when the seem to overlap with other texts, such as history
  or science? Even mentioning that century-old scuffle is nauseating. Should we
  embrace these stories––why––how? It kicks off the topics I want to cover in
  this project: life, faith, biblical hermeneutics, theology, Jesus, the gospel.

**Let's kick this whole thing off, and what better place to begin than "in the beginning". In Genesis, the foundations are laid and something elemental and irreducible is embedded the world----the forms and colors, the very spirit of what is given to us in life.

**So the first "song" in this "album" will be about creation, and may include seven small pieces (one for each day). What do I want to say, explore, chase down? For the sake a clarity, I'll break my thoughts into positive and negative----deconstructive and constructive. Here we explore the negative.**

**Firstly, Genesis is not a scientific discourse. It has nothing to say about the history of the cosmos, or the origins of biological life. It is an artistic, poetic, emotive, meaning-making, value-charged story about life and the world, taking a special look at the foundations, the genesis of our experience in the world. You can tell the story of the world from the perspective of physics or biology----that's what science does. But it is not nearly as interesting as the sacred, poetic myths which have been passed down around campfires, under the stars, from one generation to another. The meaning I find in the world is not described fully in science, and Genesis is meant to get closer to that meaning by its poetic form. This point is not something to argue about, or to take overly seriously. It's so tiresome. I think it's best to be light, humorous, and sarcastic about it. It's just not an interesting conversation, at least in the conventional framing, so I would like to poke a little fun (at myself) and move on.**

**Second, Genesis not concerned with proving the existence of God. In fact it has almost nothing to say about God, but I'll explore that more later. What I'm really thinking of here is the arduous, often hilarious "proofs for the existence of God"----the classics from Anselm, to Aquinas, to Kant, etc. These are the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, etc. Just how out of place these pieces of rhetoric in context of Genesis is very funny. Mostly I want to make fun.**

**Thirst is more serious exploration of why the rhetoric above becomes so embedded in Christian thought, and in well meaning individuals. This touches on a big theme for me: in the first place, and I would argue in Genesis, the value begins with creation, and the creator there on behalf of the creation, to back it up, hold it up. The creation is what matters----assuming we need the creator for that may be wrong or right, but that is not the point. By priority, the creation is what we are fighting for. This is then inverted, so that the creation justifies the creator----we use the value of creation to argue for and substantiate the creator. We end up diverting our allegiance to a rhetorical entity, or to the entire rhetorica system. I will say later that this is the true nature of idolatry and faith. In faith, we are for creation, because of its beauty and goodness, because it claims us. Idolatry is to invert that fidelity to something else, such as a rhetorical version of the creator, but is much more than that. It is not simply getting the object wrong, it is a change in relations. Our fidelity to creation is unconditional. It is love. We are for it. Win or lose. Because we can do no other. We are claimed by its goodness. Claimed by love. In idolatry, not only do we divert that allegiance, but we enter a new mode: that of transaction. We relate to God transactionally----we get something from the deal, as does he. It is an order of exchange. That is, if I honor my allegiance to God, I will get the value back which I have loved in the world----the value of love, my children, of life. Everything we loved and valued in the world is now made contingent on the honoring of the rhetorical god, it is placed behind the transaction, so we must pay up to receive those things. This can take any form, we may also demand success, safe passage, a deliverance from suffering, any kind of privilege from our god. So in that sense, the relationship may be weighted either way----I may be held hostage by the rhetorical god, held in fear of losing what I really life. Or I may hold more power over god----so that, by owning a theological system, by knowing the name and location of god, the shape of fidelity, the path of salvation, I have more control over god, and can easily manipulate the relationship for greater privilege. So I may dominate god, or he may dominate me, but either way, the relationship is transactional and conditional. I do think most people are more held hostage by the rhetorical god...what they love is held behind a paywall.**  

**So I would like to make a serious point about the process of falling from love into idolatry. From creation to the rhetorical creator. I would like to talk about how we slowing fall into the grip of transaction, of debt. So many are held hostage, and love is kept behind the paywall.**

**-Faith is fidelity. I am for you. Win or lose. Unconditional. Love.**

**-Idolatry is transaction. Conditional. Exchange.**
