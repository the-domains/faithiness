            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rhubard Union</h1><h2>Hey internet, thanks for being here. I wanted to get everyone together for a few reasons. First, this is just something I want to do much more often than I have been able to do for the past few years––be with friends, talk about stuff. </h2><p>I would prefer to be in someone’s home, with beer and wine, but this is a place to start. Jesus said “the Kingdom of God is upon you”. It’s not something you wait for like a revolution or apocalypse. It’s something you do–right now. So let’s do it right now. We’ll get together and just do the things we’ve been waiting for: share our thoughts, food, wine, and lives.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/36d78dd7-0c42-4312-8ae1-e085eea5e0d9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
